# Basic-Object-Detection-with-ImageAI
To perform object detection using ImageAI, all you need to do is

Install Python on your computer system
Install ImageAI and its dependencies
3. Download the Object Detection model file

4. Run the sample codes (which is as few as 10 lines)

Now letâ€™s get started.

1) Download and install Python 3 from official Python Language website

https://python.org

2) Install the following dependencies via pip:

i. Tensorflow

pip install tensorflow

ii. Numpy

pip install numpy

iii. SciPy

pip install scipy

iv. OpenCV

pip install opencv-python

v. Pillow

pip install pillow

vi. Matplotlib

pip install matplotlib

vii. H5py

pip install h5py

viii. Keras

pip install keras

ix. ImageAI

pip3 install https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/2.0.2/imageai-2.0.2-py3-none-any.whl

3) Download the RetinaNet model file that will be used for object detection via this https://github.com/OlafenwaMoses/ImageAI/releases/download/1.0/resnet50_coco_best_v2.0.1.h5.
